# Dokku Deployment Configuration for Vibe Jira Analytics

## Environment Variables (set via Dokku CLI)
# dokku config:set vibe-jira-analytics NODE_ENV=production
# dokku config:set vibe-jira-analytics PORT=3001

## Dokku Checks (Health Check Configuration)
# This app includes a health check endpoint at /api/health
# Dokku will use this for zero-downtime deployments

## Persistent Data
# The app uses /app/data for configuration and cache storage
# In production, this should be mounted as a persistent volume:
# dokku storage:mount vibe-jira-analytics /var/lib/dokku/data/storage/vibe-jira-analytics:/app/data

## Network Configuration
# The app runs on port 3001 internally
# Dokku proxy will handle external routing

## Build Configuration
# The Dockerfile includes multi-stage build:
# 1. Frontend build stage (React/Vite)
# 2. Production stage (Node.js + built frontend)

## Zero Dependencies on Local Machine
# Everything runs in the container:
# - React frontend (built during Docker build)
# - Express.js backend (serves API and static files)
# - Documentation files (served directly)
# - Data persistence (container-local storage)
